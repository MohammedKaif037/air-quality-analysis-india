# 🌍 Air Quality Analysis in Indian Cities

## Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality trends across major Indian cities, focusing on key pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, and SO2. The analysis provides insights into seasonal patterns, city-wise comparisons, and correlations between different pollutants.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Analyze trends** in air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2) over time
2. **Compare air quality** across different Indian cities
3. **Identify seasonal patterns** and potential correlations with weather data
4. **Visualize pollution levels** using line graphs, heatmaps, and time series plots

## 📊 Data Source
- **Primary**: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website
- **Alternative**: OpenAQ platform for real-time air quality data
- **Focus**: Major Indian metropolitan cities

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Static visualizations
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations

## 📋 Key Features
- ✅ Comprehensive data exploration and cleaning
- ✅ Statistical analysis of pollutant levels
- ✅ City-wise air quality comparison
- ✅ Seasonal trend analysis
- ✅ Correlation analysis between pollutants
- ✅ Multiple visualization types (bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps)
- ✅ Health impact assessment based on WHO guidelines

## 📈 Sample Results
- **Average PM2.5**: 147.0 μg/m³ (⚠️ Exceeds WHO guideline of 15 μg/m³)
- **Most Polluted City**: Delhi (PM2.5), Jaipur (NO2)
- **Seasonal Pattern**: Higher pollution in winter months
- **Key Correlation**: Strong positive correlation between PM2.5 and NO2

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

### Pollutant Analysis
- PM2.5 levels analysis across all cities
- Identification of cities exceeding WHO guidelines
- Temporal trends and seasonal variations

### City Comparisons
- Ranking of cities by pollution levels
- Regional patterns and hotspot identification
- Comparative analysis of different pollutants

### Visualizations Generated
1. **Bar Chart**: PM2.5 levels by city
2. **Scatter Plot**: PM2.5 vs NO2 correlation
3. **Time Series**: Monthly pollutant trends
4. **Heatmap**: Pollutant correlation matrix
5. **Box Plot**: Distribution analysis by city
6. **Seasonal Comparison**: Quarterly pollution patterns

## 📊 Key Findings
1. **Health Alert**: Most cities exceed WHO PM2.5 guidelines
2. **Seasonal Impact**: Winter months show 50% higher pollution
3. **Urban Hotspots**: Delhi and Mumbai consistently rank highest
4. **Pollutant Correlation**: Strong relationship between PM2.5 and NO2
